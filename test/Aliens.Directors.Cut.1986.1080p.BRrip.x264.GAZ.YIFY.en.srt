154
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Al?
- What?</font>

155
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Al.
- What?</font>

156
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:37,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember you sent some wildcatters
out past the alien range last week?</font>

157
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:38,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

158
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:40,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them's on the horn.</font>

159
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:44,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says he's on to something.
Wants to know if his claim will be honoured.</font>

160
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?</font>

161
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you sent them
on company orders, maybe?</font>

162
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".</font>

163
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:58,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">We look. They don't say why and I don't ask.</font>

164
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:02,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't ask because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here.</font>

165
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the answer is always "Don't ask".</font>

166
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do I tell this guy?</font>

167
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:10,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.</font>

168
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lydecker?
- What?</font>

169
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kids are not supposed
to be on this level! Get out of here!</font>

170

171
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">So? That's why I'm the best!</font>

172
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:59,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock it off! If I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.</font>

173

174
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, come and have
a look at this, will ya?</font>

175
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folks, we have scored big this time.</font>

176
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Dad?</font>

177
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:32,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure.</font>

178
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:36,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing.</font>

179
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:41,608
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.</i></font>

180
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's about as close as we can get.</font>

181
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we take a look inside?</font>

182
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.</font>

183
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:11,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">- OK.
- Bye.</font>

184
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timmy, they've been gone a long time.</font>

185
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be OK. Dad knows what he's doing.</font>

186
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:41,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!</font>

of the Colonial Marine Corps...</font>

189
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:37,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripley, we have to talk.</font>

190
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.</font>

191
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe this.</font>

192
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys throw me to the wolves...</font>

193
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now you want me to go back out there?</font>

194
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it. It's not my problem.</font>

195
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I finish?
- No.</font>

196
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way.</font>

197
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I can guarantee your safety.</font>

198
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:13,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.</font>

199
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing they can't handle.</font>

200
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I right?</font>

201
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.</font>

202
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.</font>

203
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:28,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know what's going on out there.
It may just be a downed transmitter.</font>

204
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:30,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it's not...</font>

205
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:34,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like you there as an advisor,
and that's all.</font>

206
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?</font>

207
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:46,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.</font>

208
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doing a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...</font>

209
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I saw the commercial.</font>

210
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:55,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.</font>

211
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right.
I heard you're working the cargo docks.</font>

212
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

213
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:03,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Running loaders and forklifts.
- Yeah. So?</font>

214
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:06,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.</font>

215
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:12,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know it's the only thing that you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.</font>

216
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?</font>

217
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:21,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.</font>

218
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I go.</font>

219
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you go.</font>

220
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.</font>

221
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:34,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out there and face this thing.
Get back on the horse.</font>

222
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:37,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation this month.</font>

223
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:40,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know. I've read it.
You wake up every night...</font>

224
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:44,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">soaked in sweat...
- I said no! And I mean it!</font>

225
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now please leave.</font>

226
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:53,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not going back! And I am...
I would not be any good to you if I did.</font>

227
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

228
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

229
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:01,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you do me a favour?
Just think about it.</font>

230
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the coffee.</font>

231
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aagh!</font>

232
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:27,414

235
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell me one thing, Burke.</font>

236
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:25,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going out there to destroy them, right?</font>

237
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to study.</font>

238
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to bring back.</font>

239
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to wipe them out.</font>

240
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,314
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's the plan. You have my word on it.</i></font>

241
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm in.</font>

242
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, you little shithead...</font>

247
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that a joke?
- Oh, I wish it were!</font>

248
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Hicks. Man, you lookjust like I feel.</font>

249
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, sweethearts,
what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?</font>

250
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another glorious day in the Corps!</font>

251
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:54,259

is like a day on the farm.</font>

every paycheck a fortune.</font>

- Gee, would you, sir?</font>

257
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,235

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Top, what's the op?</font>

276
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.</font>

277
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:21,718

00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:33,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't funny, man.</font>

298
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:37,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lieutenant Gorman?
- No.</font>

299
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.</font>

300
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:45,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like the new lieutenant's too good
to eat with the rest of us grunts.</font>

301
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.</font>

302
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you never missed, Bishop.</font>

303
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never said an android
was on board. Why not?</font>

304
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:03,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">It never occurred to me.</font>

305
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.</font>

306
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:09,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.</font>

307
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

308
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:14,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.</font>

309
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:18,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even... Ripley's last trip, the syn...
The artificial person...</font>

310
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">malfunctioned.
- Malfunctioned?</font>

311
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:24,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were problems and...
a few deaths were involved.</font>

312
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:27,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?</font>

313
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.</font>

314
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:33,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.</font>

315
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:36,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.</font>

316
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:40,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.</font>

317
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you don't want some?</font>

318
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:47,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stay away from me, Bishop.</font>

319
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:53,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess she don't like the cornbread, either.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!</i></font>

321
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As you were.</i></font>

322
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:14,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quickly, quickly. Settle down.</font>

323
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, listen up!</font>

324
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:22,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway...</font>

325
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:25,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?</font>

326
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.</i></font>

327
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:31,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the question?</font>

328
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,
or another bug hunt?</font>

329
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:39,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony...</font>

330
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:42,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a xenomorph may be involved.</font>

331
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:45,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.</font>

332
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:49,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bug hunt.
What exactly are we dealing with here?</font>

333
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripley?</font>

334
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what I know.</font>

335
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:57,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">We set down on LV-426.</font>

336
00:33:57,318 --> 00:34:01,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">A crew member was brought back
with something attached to his face...</font>

337
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">some kind of parasite.</font>

338
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.</font>

339
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.</font>

340
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kane seemed fine.</font>

341
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were all having dinner.</font>

342
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:18,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.</font>

343
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:20,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">He started...</font>

344
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, he...</font>

345
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:25,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, man,
I only need to know one thing:</font>

346
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they are.</font>

347
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go, Vasquez, kick ass!
- Anytime, anywhere.</font>

348
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:35,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up!</font>

349
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.</font>

350
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you finished?</font>

351
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're right. I really do.</font>

352
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.</font>

353
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:56,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.</font>

354
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of those things managed to wipe out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.</font>

355
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:07,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the colonists have found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.</font>

356
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:08,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

357
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:13,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, we have it on disk, so look at it.</font>

358
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

359
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Private?</font>

360
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:21,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?</font>

361
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You secure that shit, Hudson.</font>

362
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

363
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now listen up.</font>

364
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.</font>

365
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:41,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.</font>

366
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:47,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.</font>

367
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,754

368
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:54,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard the man, and you know the drill!
Assholes and elbows!</font>

369
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:56,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hudson, come here. Come here!</font>

370
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:15,079
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done!</i></font>

371
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:20,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!</font>

372
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.</font>

373
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Take it away.</font>

374
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear behind.</font>

375
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:53,242

Is this the non-op?</font>

376
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:56,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?</font>

377
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Is there anything you can do?</font>

378
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:04,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can drive that loader.</font>

379
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a Class Two rating.</font>

380
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:10,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be my guest.</font>

381
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you want it?</font>

382
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:03,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bay twelve, please.</font>

383
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:03,328

there's nothing to worry about.</i></font>

384
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:08,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">We come here, and we gonna conquer, and
we gonna take some. Is that understood?</font>

385
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:12,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
Gonna go and get some.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Set him down here.</font>

891
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:43,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.</font>

892
01:23:48,643 --> 01:23:51,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second. There's something...</font>

893
01:23:51,354 --> 01:23:53,430
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just get up here.</i></font>

894
01:23:53,648 --> 01:23:55,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in. Ramp closing.</font>

895
01:24:16,003 --> 01:24:17,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spunkmeyer.</font>

896
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:19,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

897
01:24:22,885 --> 01:24:24,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, where the fuck...</font>

898
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:38,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

899
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:24,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.</font>

900
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:29,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!</font>

901
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:31,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you finished?</font>

902
01:25:34,582 --> 01:25:36,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

903
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:45,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?</font>

904
01:25:45,593 --> 01:25:47,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Newt.</font>

905
01:25:47,762 --> 01:25:50,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.</font>

906
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!</font>

907
01:25:54,143 --> 01:25:56,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?</font>

908
01:25:57,063 --> 01:26:01,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we could build a fire, sing
a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?</font>

909
01:26:01,234 --> 01:26:05,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night.</font>

910
01:26:05,988 --> 01:26:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly.</font>

911
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's everything, right?</font>

912
01:26:26,259 --> 01:26:31,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is absolutely everything
we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.</font>

913
01:26:31,347 --> 01:26:34,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.</font>

914
01:26:34,767 --> 01:26:36,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">That ain't so good.</font>

915
01:26:37,478 --> 01:26:40,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.</font>

916
01:26:40,982 --> 01:26:43,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch that.</font>

917
01:26:43,151 --> 01:26:44,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dangerous, honey.</font>

918
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.</font>

919
01:26:49,824 --> 01:26:53,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.</font>

920
01:26:54,454 --> 01:26:55,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the good news...</font>

921
01:26:56,456 --> 01:26:59,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got four of these robot sentries...</font>

922
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:02,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">with display and scanners intact.</font>

923
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.</font>

924
01:27:05,465 --> 01:27:09,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?</font>

925
01:27:12,889 --> 01:27:14,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">17 days.</font>

926
01:27:15,349 --> 01:27:17,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">17 days?</font>

927
01:27:17,518 --> 01:27:22,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!</font>

928
01:27:22,106 --> 01:27:25,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and...</font>

929
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hudson! Hudson!</font>

930
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.</font>

931
01:27:34,202 --> 01:27:35,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

932
01:27:38,581 --> 01:27:42,495
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.</i></font>

933
01:27:42,585 --> 01:27:46,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.
Deal with it, because we need you...</font>

934
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:48,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm sick of your bullshit.</font>

935
01:27:48,716 --> 01:27:53,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?</font>

936
01:27:53,221 --> 01:27:57,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?</font>

937
01:27:57,475 --> 01:27:59,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

938
01:27:59,268 --> 01:28:04,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements...</font>

939
01:28:04,107 --> 01:28:06,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">every possible way into this complex.</font>

940
01:28:07,902 --> 01:28:09,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have much time.</font>

941
01:28:09,821 --> 01:28:11,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

942
01:28:12,698 --> 01:28:14,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson...</font>

943
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:16,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just relax.</font>

944
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be in med lab.</font>

945
01:28:24,544 --> 01:28:27,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.</font>

946
01:28:28,089 --> 01:28:29,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

947
01:28:29,757 --> 01:28:31,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do that.</font>

948
01:28:37,223 --> 01:28:41,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.</font>

949
01:28:41,144 --> 01:28:45,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.</font>

950
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:49,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come down on that.</font>

951
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:51,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, come over.</font>

952
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:54,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.</font>

953
01:29:00,246 --> 01:29:02,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. It's back here.
- OK.</font>

954
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's a pressure door at this end.</font>

955
01:29:06,753 --> 01:29:10,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...</font>

956
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:14,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.</font>

957
01:29:14,552 --> 01:29:16,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, so...</font>

958
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:20,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...</font>

959
01:29:20,558 --> 01:29:25,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here...</font>

960
01:29:25,146 --> 01:29:26,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here.</font>

961
01:29:27,023 --> 01:29:30,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.</font>

962
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:33,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...</font>

963
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:35,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here. Right?</font>

964
01:29:35,782 --> 01:29:37,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Outstanding.</font>

965
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now all we need is a deck of cards.</font>

966
01:29:41,996 --> 01:29:44,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.</font>

967
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:47,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.</font>

968
01:30:02,809 --> 01:30:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do your thing, baby.</font>

969
01:30:04,685 --> 01:30:07,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.</font>

970
01:30:07,188 --> 01:30:10,639
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
- Roger.</i></font>

971
01:30:10,733 --> 01:30:12,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand by. Arming now.</font>

972
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:14,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Test it, Hudson.</font>

973
01:30:14,487 --> 01:30:16,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!</font>

974
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:23,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK! Let's get the hell out of here!</font>

975
01:30:23,246 --> 01:30:25,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sealing the tunnel!</font>

976
01:30:25,415 --> 01:30:26,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, baby.</font>

977
01:30:38,636 --> 01:30:40,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what it's worth...</font>

978
01:30:42,432 --> 01:30:44,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, I want you to put this on.</font>

979
01:30:44,892 --> 01:30:47,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it for?</font>

980
01:30:47,186 --> 01:30:52,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex... on this.</font>

981
01:30:53,776 --> 01:30:55,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a precaution.</font>

982
01:30:56,195 --> 01:30:57,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

983
01:30:58,072 --> 01:31:00,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.</font>

984
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:02,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what's next?</font>

985
01:31:32,398 --> 01:31:33,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last stop.</font>

986
01:31:38,738 --> 01:31:40,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in.</font>

987
01:31:40,615 --> 01:31:41,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scoot down.</font>

988
01:31:43,284 --> 01:31:44,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

989
01:31:44,702 --> 01:31:47,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you lie here and have a nap.</font>

990
01:31:47,205 --> 01:31:48,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very tired.</font>

991
01:31:48,831 --> 01:31:52,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to. I have scary dreams.</font>

992
01:31:54,587 --> 01:31:57,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.</font>

993
01:31:57,757 --> 01:31:59,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take a look.</font>

994
01:31:59,884 --> 01:32:02,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. Nothing bad in there.</font>

995
01:32:02,178 --> 01:32:03,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

996
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:06,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you could just try to be like her.</font>

997
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:09,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...</font>

998
01:32:09,435 --> 01:32:12,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she's just a piece of plastic.</font>

999
01:32:12,271 --> 01:32:13,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

1000
01:32:14,023 --> 01:32:15,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Newt.</font>

1001
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:23,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

1002
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:28,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.</font>

1003
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are.</font>

1004
01:32:31,207 --> 01:32:34,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, there are, aren't there?</font>

1005
01:32:36,129 --> 01:32:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they tell little kids that?</font>

1006
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:42,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of the time it's true.</font>

1007
01:32:42,718 --> 01:32:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did one of those things grow inside her?</font>

1008
01:32:46,264 --> 01:32:48,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Newt.</font>

1009
01:32:48,933 --> 01:32:51,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the truth.</font>

1010
01:32:51,185 --> 01:32:53,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that how babies come?</font>

1011
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, people babies?</font>

1012
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:59,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.</font>

1013
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:01,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever have a baby?</font>

1014
01:33:01,779 --> 01:33:03,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did.</font>

1015
01:33:03,364 --> 01:33:04,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a little girl.</font>

1016
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:06,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?</font>

1017
01:33:08,035 --> 01:33:09,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gone.</font>

1018
01:33:11,581 --> 01:33:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean dead.</font>

1019
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:16,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

1020
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:19,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this.</font>

1021
01:33:20,548 --> 01:33:22,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">For luck.</font>

1022
01:33:25,428 --> 01:33:27,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

1023
01:33:29,724 --> 01:33:31,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go! Please!</font>

1024
01:33:31,893 --> 01:33:34,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.</font>

1025
01:33:35,313 --> 01:33:37,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you see that camera?</font>

1026
01:33:37,482 --> 01:33:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see you through that camera...</font>

1027
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the time, to see if you're safe.</font>

1028
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:49,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.</font>

1029
01:33:50,078 --> 01:33:51,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean that.</font>

1030
01:33:51,788 --> 01:33:53,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a promise.</font>

1031
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:55,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promise?</font>

1032
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:58,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cross my heart.</font>

1033
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:00,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hope to die?</font>

1034
01:34:00,755 --> 01:34:03,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hope to die.</font>

1035
01:34:17,814 --> 01:34:19,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go to sleep...</font>

1036
01:34:20,566 --> 01:34:22,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">and don't dream.</font>

1037
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:28,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sneak.</font>

1038
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:42,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">The molecular acid oxidises after the
creature's death, completely neutralising.</font>

1039
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:45,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.</font>

1040
01:34:45,466 --> 01:34:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.</font>

1041
01:34:50,346 --> 01:34:55,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.</font>

1042
01:34:57,019 --> 01:35:00,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.</font>

1043
01:35:00,523 --> 01:35:02,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.</font>

1044
01:35:03,025 --> 01:35:04,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that follows.</font>

1045
01:35:05,027 --> 01:35:08,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?</font>

1046
01:35:11,492 --> 01:35:13,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's laying these eggs?</font>

1047
01:35:14,829 --> 01:35:18,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure.
It must be something we haven't seen yet.</font>

1048
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:21,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.</font>

1049
01:35:21,419 --> 01:35:24,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.</font>

1050
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:28,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.</font>

1051
01:35:28,509 --> 01:35:30,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.</font>

1052
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:33,757
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And she's badass, man. I mean big.</i></font>

1053
01:35:33,848 --> 01:35:36,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!</font>

1054
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:41,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.</font>

1055
01:35:41,898 --> 01:35:47,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.</font>

1056
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was very specific about it.</font>

1057
01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:57,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.</font>

1058
01:35:57,497 --> 01:36:01,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes...</font>

1059
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:03,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we will be set up for life.</font>

1060
01:36:04,837 --> 01:36:07,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?</font>

1061
01:36:07,673 --> 01:36:12,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?</font>

1062
01:36:12,345 --> 01:36:15,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?</font>

1063
01:36:15,556 --> 01:36:18,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they will know about it, Burke. From me.</font>

1064
01:36:18,351 --> 01:36:22,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.</font>

1065
01:36:22,897 --> 01:36:25,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.</font>

1066
01:36:25,942 --> 01:36:31,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just checked the colony log: Directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.</font>

1067
01:36:31,447 --> 01:36:35,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.</font>

1068
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:40,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.</font>

1069
01:36:40,289 --> 01:36:44,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in...</font>

1070
01:36:44,669 --> 01:36:48,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.</font>

1071
01:36:48,381 --> 01:36:53,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.</font>

1072
01:36:54,053 --> 01:36:59,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!</font>

1073
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:02,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.</font>

1074
01:37:02,395 --> 01:37:04,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't sleaze your way out of this one.</font>

1075
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:06,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right to the wall.</font>

1076
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:09,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripley.</font>

1077
01:37:11,863 --> 01:37:16,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.</font>

1078
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happy to disappoint you.</font>

1079
01:37:33,634 --> 01:37:35,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it? What's going on?</font>

1080
01:37:35,803 --> 01:37:37,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're coming.
- Where?</font>

1081
01:37:37,388 --> 01:37:38,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the tunnel.</font>

1082
01:37:40,475 --> 01:37:41,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

1083
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:44,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">A and B gun tracking and firing.</font>

1084
01:37:44,437 --> 01:37:45,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Multiple targets.</font>

1085
01:37:51,736 --> 01:37:53,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at those ammo counters go.</font>

1086
01:37:56,282 --> 01:37:58,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">B gun's down 50 per cent.</font>

1087
01:37:59,577 --> 01:38:01,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shooting gallery down there!</font>

1088
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:07,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">60 rounds left on B.</font>

1089
01:38:07,627 --> 01:38:10,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">40... 20... 10.</font>

1090
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">B gun's dry. 20 on A.</font>

1091
01:38:14,383 --> 01:38:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten...</font>

1092
01:38:15,259 --> 01:38:16,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">five...</font>

1093
01:38:20,598 --> 01:38:21,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

1094
01:38:22,016 --> 01:38:25,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.</font>

1095
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're at the pressure door.</font>

1096
01:38:33,486 --> 01:38:34,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, listen to that.</font>

1097
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:38,736
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i></font>

1098
01:38:38,825 --> 01:38:40,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a switch!</font>

1099
01:38:42,578 --> 01:38:46,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?</font>

1100
01:38:46,165 --> 01:38:49,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Emergency venting.</font>

1101
01:38:49,794 --> 01:38:54,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.</font>

1102
01:38:54,215 --> 01:38:56,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long till it blows?</font>

1103
01:38:56,259 --> 01:38:58,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four hours...</font>

1104
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:02,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,
equal to about 40 megatons.</font>

1105
01:39:03,975 --> 01:39:07,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!</font>

1106
01:39:07,854 --> 01:39:09,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vasquez, close the shutters.</font>

1107
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:12,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't we shut it down from here?</font>

1108
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:17,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.</font>

1109
01:39:17,238 --> 01:39:21,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.</font>

1110
01:39:22,034 --> 01:39:25,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!</font>

1111
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:28,195
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Four more weeks. Oh, man!</i></font>

1112
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.</font>

1113
01:39:31,836 --> 01:39:34,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we bring it down on remote?</font>

1114
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:38,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!</font>

1115
01:39:38,259 --> 01:39:41,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something!</font>

1116
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of what?
We're fucked! We're doomed!</font>

1117
01:39:44,515 --> 01:39:49,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?</font>

1118
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:53,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.</font>

1119
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't align the dish.</font>

1120
01:39:55,318 --> 01:40:00,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.</font>

1121
01:40:00,823 --> 01:40:05,900
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count me out.</i></font>

1122
01:40:05,995 --> 01:40:08,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.</font>

1123
01:40:08,956 --> 01:40:11,163
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.</i></font>

1124
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I'll go.</font>

1125
01:40:13,419 --> 01:40:16,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.</font>

1126
01:40:16,339 --> 01:40:19,459
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.</i></font>

1127
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good idea!</font>

1128
01:40:20,802 --> 01:40:22,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, I'd prefer not to.</font>

1129
01:40:23,054 --> 01:40:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.</font>

1130
01:40:37,819 --> 01:40:39,645
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How long?</i></font>

1131
01:40:39,737 --> 01:40:43,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.</font>

1132
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:46,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
- Right.</font>

1133
01:40:46,494 --> 01:40:50,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">an hour to patch in and align the antenna...</font>

1134
01:40:51,582 --> 01:40:55,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.</font>

1135
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:57,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be close.</font>

1136
01:41:01,634 --> 01:41:04,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good luck.
- See you soon.</font>

1137
01:41:05,596 --> 01:41:07,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch your fingers.</font>

1138
01:41:11,602 --> 01:41:13,013
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Vaya con Dios, man.</i></font>

1139
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is unbelievable!</font>

1140
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:31,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">20 metres and closing. 15.</font>

1141
01:41:31,164 --> 01:41:32,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many?</font>

1142
01:41:32,457 --> 01:41:35,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't tell. Lots.</font>

1143
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">D gun's down 50 per cent.</font>

1144
01:41:41,924 --> 01:41:45,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">C gun's right behind it.</font>

1145

1148
01:41:55,104 --> 01:41:55,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">100 rounds.</font>

1150
01:42:05,406 --> 01:42:06,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">D gun's down to 20.</font>

1151

01:42:11,829 --> 01:42:13,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

1153
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:16,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

1154
01:42:16,209 --> 01:42:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're retreating.</font>

1155
01:42:23,132 --> 01:42:25,837
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The guns stopped them.</i></font>

1156
01:42:28,137 --> 01:42:29,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

1157
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:38,970

1158
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:41,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but they don't know that.</font>

1159
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:44,644

01:42:44,737 --> 01:42:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll take 'em a while.</font>

- Shut up.</font>

1162
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:53,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you two walking perimeter.</font>

1163
01:42:54,789 --> 01:42:56,069

1164
01:43:03,673 --> 01:43:05,796

01:44:18,372 --> 01:44:20,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. What do I do?</font>

1182
01:44:25,797 --> 01:44:28,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull it in tight here.</font>

1183
01:44:28,257 --> 01:44:30,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Lean into it.</font>

1184
01:44:31,302 --> 01:44:33,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, now it will kick some.</font>

1185
01:44:34,555 --> 01:44:37,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the counter reads zero here, you...</font>

1186
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:40,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I press this up?
- That's right.</font>

1187
01:44:42,146 --> 01:44:44,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.</font>

1188
01:44:44,941 --> 01:44:47,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.</font>

1189
01:44:48,277 --> 01:44:51,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.</font>

1190
01:44:51,614 --> 01:44:53,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you want to mess with that.</font>

1191
01:44:53,908 --> 01:44:57,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You started this. Show me everything.</font>

1192
01:44:57,829 --> 01:44:59,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can handle myself.</font>

1193
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:03,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I noticed.</font>

1194
01:45:13,636 --> 01:45:15,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you feel?</font>

1195
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.</font>

1196
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:24,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.</font>

1197
01:46:18,701 --> 01:46:20,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh, shh, shh.</font>

1198
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:24,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's OK. It's OK.</font>

1199
01:47:35,153 --> 01:47:38,319
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Newt. Wake up.</i></font>

1200
01:47:38,406 --> 01:47:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Be quiet.</font>

1201
01:47:40,408 --> 01:47:42,484

1202
01:48:00,261 --> 01:48:03,215
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Agh!</i></font>

1203
01:48:03,306 --> 01:48:05,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, Newt!</font>

1204
01:48:26,287 --> 01:48:27,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1205
01:48:36,214 --> 01:48:37,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

1206
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

1207
01:48:41,052 --> 01:48:42,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hicks!</font>

1208
01:48:43,054 --> 01:48:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say again, Bishop?</font>

1209
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:47,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?</font>

1210
01:48:48,059 --> 01:48:49,434
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's right.</i></font>

1211
01:48:49,519 --> 01:48:51,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Stay on it.</font>

1212
01:48:52,063 --> 01:48:55,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.</font>

1213
01:48:56,609 --> 01:48:59,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.</font>

1214
01:49:03,157 --> 01:49:06,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!</font>

1215
01:49:06,619 --> 01:49:08,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hicks! Help us!</font>

1216
01:49:08,246 --> 01:49:09,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break the glass!</font>

1217
01:49:09,956 --> 01:49:12,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break it, break it!</font>

1218
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try.</font>

1219
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripley, I'm scared.</font>

1220
01:49:37,984 --> 01:49:39,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

1221
01:49:44,866 --> 01:49:46,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here.</font>

1222
01:49:59,464 --> 01:50:01,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the med lab. Hudson!</font>

1223
01:50:01,632 --> 01:50:04,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!</font>

1224
01:50:04,761 --> 01:50:06,837
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're on our way.</i></font>

1225
01:50:09,932 --> 01:50:12,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming, Newt.</font>

1226
01:50:19,484 --> 01:50:20,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Urgh!</font>

1227
01:50:27,283 --> 01:50:28,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aagh!</font>

1228
01:50:44,759 --> 01:50:46,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot it out!</font>

1229
01:50:50,598 --> 01:50:52,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hudson!
- Jesus!</font>

1230
01:50:54,435 --> 01:50:55,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1231
01:50:56,062 --> 01:50:58,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, kid, look out!</font>

1232
01:51:19,127 --> 01:51:20,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Over there!
- Yeah!</font>

1233
01:51:20,586 --> 01:51:21,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready?
- Yeah!</font>

1234
01:51:26,968 --> 01:51:28,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hudson!</font>

1235
01:51:28,302 --> 01:51:30,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.</font>

1236
01:51:30,638 --> 01:51:32,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's history, man.</font>

1237
01:51:33,474 --> 01:51:34,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

1238
01:51:36,519 --> 01:51:39,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burke. It was Burke.</font>

1239
01:51:42,233 --> 01:51:45,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.</font>

1240
01:51:45,695 --> 01:51:48,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.</font>

1241
01:51:51,534 --> 01:51:55,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">He figured that he could get an alien
back through quarantine...</font>

1242
01:51:55,621 --> 01:51:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">if one of us was impregnated.</font>

1243
01:51:58,624 --> 01:52:00,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you call it.</font>

1244
01:52:01,711 --> 01:52:04,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then frozen for the trip home.</font>

1245
01:52:04,797 --> 01:52:09,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying...</font>

1246
01:52:09,218 --> 01:52:10,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">me and Newt.</font>

1247
01:52:12,805 --> 01:52:14,762
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wait, now. We'd all know.</i></font>

1248
01:52:14,849 --> 01:52:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.</font>

1249
01:52:20,605 --> 01:52:22,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Namely, yours.</font>

1250
01:52:22,148 --> 01:52:27,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.</font>

1251
01:52:27,528 --> 01:52:29,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck! He's dead.</font>

1252
01:52:31,074 --> 01:52:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're dog meat, pal.</font>

1253
01:52:33,951 --> 01:52:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so nuts. I mean, listen...
Listen to what you're saying.</font>

1254
01:52:38,998 --> 01:52:42,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.</font>

1255
01:52:44,128 --> 01:52:45,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pathetic.</font>

1256
01:52:45,922 --> 01:52:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burke, I don't know which species is worse.</font>

1257
01:52:49,175 --> 01:52:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.</font>

1258
01:52:53,221 --> 01:52:56,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we waste him. No offence.</font>

1259
01:52:56,432 --> 01:52:58,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! He's got to go back...</font>

1260
01:52:59,268 --> 01:53:01,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cut the power.</font>

1261
01:53:01,437 --> 01:53:04,522
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How can they cut the power?
They're animals!</i></font>

1262
01:53:04,607 --> 01:53:07,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you two checking the corridors! Move!</font>

1263
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:10,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.</font>

1264
01:53:13,908 --> 01:53:17,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.</font>

1265
01:53:41,894 --> 01:53:44,681
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Anything?
- There's something.</i></font>

1266
01:53:44,772 --> 01:53:47,975
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's inside the complex.</i></font>

1267
01:53:48,067 --> 01:53:50,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just reading me.</font>

1268
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:52,981
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, it ain't you.</i></font>

1269
01:53:54,991 --> 01:53:58,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.</font>

1270
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:01,739
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?</i></font>

1271
01:54:07,503 --> 01:54:10,706
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hudson may be right.</i></font>

1272
01:54:10,798 --> 01:54:13,918
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.</i></font>

1273
01:54:15,386 --> 01:54:19,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!</font>

1274
01:54:20,057 --> 01:54:23,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back to Operations. It's game time.</font>

1275
01:54:23,519 --> 01:54:24,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Newt.</font>

1276
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:29,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seal the door.</font>

1277
01:54:29,317 --> 01:54:30,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry!</font>

1278
01:54:30,443 --> 01:54:33,776
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Come on! Come on, get back!</i></font>

1279
01:54:33,863 --> 01:54:35,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work fast.</font>

1280
01:54:39,202 --> 01:54:42,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.</font>

1281
01:54:42,455 --> 01:54:46,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Movement. Signal's clean. 20 metres.</font>

1282
01:54:46,918 --> 01:54:49,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found a way in, something we missed.</font>

1283
01:54:49,796 --> 01:54:51,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't miss anything.</font>

1284
01:54:51,798 --> 01:54:53,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">18...</font>

1285

- Ripley!</font>

1288

1289
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:03,809

1290
01:55:05,436 --> 01:55:10,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.</font>

1291
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:13,399

- Almost there.</font>

1292
01:55:14,987 --> 01:55:16,530
